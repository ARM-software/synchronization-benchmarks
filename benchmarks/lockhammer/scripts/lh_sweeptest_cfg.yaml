## Sweep Test Settings
#
# Common assumptions for sweeptest:
# CPU Frequency = 2GHz
# CPU Cycle = 0.5ns
# Remote DRAM (x86_64 or aarch64, NUMA) = 100ns ~ 300ns
# Page Fault (4KB, x86_64) = 2000 cycles = 1000ns
# Therefore we set critical section delay (-c) to 0ns, 200ns and 1000ns
# We also set post critical section delay (-p) to 5x of (-c) value
# By default, sweeptest will sweep sweepargu (-t) from 1 to max core count
