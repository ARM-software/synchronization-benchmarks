Lockhammer
==========

This is a simple locks and sychronization performance evaulation tool which can
be used to characterize the performance of high core-count systems or compare
software algorithms.  Several basic primitives are included and third-party
algorithms can easily be integrated.

Build & Run
===========

Simply 'make' in this directory to produce a lockhammer executable for each
supported algorithm.  In order to more accurately characterize performance
lockhammer selects the FIFO scheduler and as such must be run as root.  Be
Aware that running FIFO scheduled threads on all cores for extended periods
of time can result in responsiveness and stability issues.  Lockhammer should
never be run on an already-deployed  system and parameters such as acquires
per thread and critical section lengths should be tuned to ensure the entire
run lasts for a short period of time.  Some simple scripts for running sweeps
of different core counts is available in the `scripts/`_. directory.

Locks or synchronization primitives are stressed by acquiring and releasing
them at a rate deterimined by a command-line selectable number of critical
and post-release wait loop iterations.  The default is to not wait between
acquire and release or re-acquire attempts (acquire and release as quickly
as possible).

Detailed information about each run is printed to stderr while a CSV summary
is printed to stdout.

Software Dependencies
---------------------

+ gcc
+ python3
+ sh python3 module
+ yaml python3 module

Guide for Redhat Enterprise Linux 8.1
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    dnf install gcc hwloc-gui python3 python3-pip python3-yaml
    pip3 install sh
    git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/synchronization-benchmarks.git
    cd synchronization-benchmarks/benchmarks/lockhammer
    make
    cd scripts
    ./runall.sh

Guide for Ubuntu 19.04
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    apt install hwloc python3-sh
    git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/synchronization-benchmarks.git
    cd synchronization-benchmarks/benchmarks/lockhammer
    make
    cd scripts
    ./runall.sh


Usage
=====

The build system will generate a separate lockhammer binary for each test with
the format lh_[testname]. Each lockhammer binary accepts the following options:
::
    [-t threads]    Number of threads to exercise, default online cores
    [-a acquires]   Number of acquisitions per thread, default 50000
    [-c critical]   Critical section in loop iterations, default 0
    [-p parallel]   Parallelizable section in loop iterations, default 0
    [-s]            Run in safe mode with normal priority threads instead of RT_FIFO priority, default no


Plotting
========

The default plotting script utilizes jupyter-notebook, matplotlib, seaborn
and pandas under python3 environment. For Ubuntu on x86_64 machine, the
following packages have to be installed:
apt install build-essential python3 python3-pip jupyter-notebook

For aarch64 machine, additional packages are also needed:
apt install pkg-config libfreetype6-dev python3-scipy

Then pip3 can install all plotting related libraries with the following cmd:
pip3 install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy

Note, seaborn has to be installed without scipy as dependency on aarch64:
pip3 install seaborn --no-dependencies

The jupyter-notebook can be started with:
jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port=8888

Now any browser should be able to access the jupyter notebook called:
lockhammer-jupyter-notebook.ipynb

Start a browser, with IP address set to the jupyter server IP and port 8888:
e.g. http://example.test.com:8888

Click the notebook named lockhammer-jupyter-notebook.ipynb, run each cell one
by one and jupyter should be able to generate the png graph locally.
