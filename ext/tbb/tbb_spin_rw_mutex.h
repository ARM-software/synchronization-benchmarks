/*
 *  Based on:
 *
 *      Project: github.com/01org/tbb, File: tbb/include/tbb/spin_rw_mutex.h
 *      Tag: 2018_U3-0-g633b01a
 *
 *  Description:
 *
 *      This file implements 'Fast, unfair, spinning reader-writer lock with
 *      back-off and writer-preference'. The algorithm is based on
 *      'spin_rw_mutex' from Intel TBB library.
 *
 *  Internals:
 *
 *      - Cutting through layers of abstractions in the original source code, I
 *      made things not as clean as it was. However, during the porting
 *      process, I tried to keep things as similar as possible to the setup in
 *      the Intel TBB library. I ported only required things for this
 *      synchronization scheme to work.
 *
 *      - The lockhammer/tbb.h file tries to provide similar __TBB level
 *      abstractions as tbb/include/tbb/tbb_machine.h but it is primitive and
 *      has only definitions needed for this particular scheme.
 *
 *      - Underlying atomics primitives are from GCC built-ins as configured in
 *      gcc_generic.h file in tbb project for Aarch64. For x86-64 they are
 *      derived from tbb/include/tbb/machine/linux_intel64.h file. The expected
 *      ISA is either x86-64 (no TSX) or Aarch64, 64bit only and the OS is
 *      Linux (for sched_yield).
 *
 *      - For Aarch64, TBB is using GCC generic atomic built-ins as a base. It
 *      does not assume anything about memory model or ISA. So, the
 *      implementation could be suboptimal. We inherit those traits here as
 *      well.
 *
 *      - In lockhammer/tbb.h, there are several macros which allow you to
 *      select which variant of atomics to use. For Aarch64, the default is GCC
 *      built-ins, and for x86-64, the defaults are supplied by the file. These
 *      default choices are similar to the TBB setup.
 *
 *  Changes from TBB:
 *
 *      - One main change is in the definition of 'machine_pause()'. Here, it
 *      would first spin and then sched_yield() unlike the default in TBB where
 *      it would sched_yield() immediately (at least for Aarch64).
 *
 *      - Does not implement upgrade() or downgrade() methods
 *
 *      - Not using C++ because it is difficult given this benchmark framework
 *      as well as the other complexities which comes from pulling out a set of
 *      classes from a class tree in tbb.
 *
 *  Workings:
 *
 *      This implements classical reader-writer lock. Which means a lock can be
 *      held by a single writer or a group of readers at the same time but not
 *      both.
 *
 *      From tbb docs: " Mutual exclusion is necessary when at least one thread
 *      writes to a shared variable. But it does no harm to permit multiple
 *      readers into a protected region. The reader-writer variants of the
 *      mutexes [...] enable multiple readers by distinguishing reader locks
 *      from writer locks. There can be more than one reader lock on a given
 *      mutex."
 *
 *      When a writer first tries to acquire the lock, if there are no readers
 *      already holding the lock, it will acquire it else in the presence of
 *      readers it will set a writer pending bit if not set. If this bit is
 *      already set or after setting the bit the writer will start backing off
 *      eventually yielding the CPU until obtaining the lock.
 *
 *      In case of readers, more than one of them can go in the exclusive
 *      section simultaneously. If no writer is holding the lock or no pending
 *      writers, a reader even in presence of other reader can acquire the lock.
 *      It will back off and eventually yield the CPU when writer is holding a
 *      lock until the lock becomes available again.
 *
 *  Readers/Writers ratio (-r) and Pure readers (-m):
 *
 *      - 'rw_mask' variable defines the ratio between readers and writers per
 *      thread. It is controlled using log2_ratio variable, cmdline args -r.
 *
 *      - Given the ratio, a thread will perform that many 'read_acquire' and
 *      'read_release' calls and then it will do one 'write_acquire' and
 *      'write_release'. And then if more work to be done, repeat.
 *
 *      For a thread:
 *
 *      num readers
 *      ----------- = 2^(log2_ratio) - 1;
 *      num writers
 *
 *       > log2_ratio of  0 means all writers
 *       > log2_ratio of ~0 means all readers
 *       > default log2_ratio is 6 e.g 63 reads per write.
 *
 *      - Pure readers are CPUs which will never perform a write acq/rel. The
 *        cmdline arg is a bit mask e.g. 0x8 will make 4th cpu (cpu id: 0x3)
 *        a pure reader. Default is 0x0 e.g. no pure readers.
